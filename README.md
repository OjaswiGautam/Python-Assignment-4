Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

This program checks whether a text file named sample.txt exists. If the file is found, it reads and displays the content line by line with line numbers. If the file does not exist, an appropriate error message is displayed.

Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File

This program takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt. It then appends additional input to the same file, reads the final content, and displays it on the screen.
